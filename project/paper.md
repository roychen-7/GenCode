ABSTRACT
The recent boom of linear forecasting models questions the ongoing passion for
architectural modifications of Transformer-based forecasters. These forecasters
leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of
time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp.
However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback
windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the
embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates that represent potential
delayed events and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning
variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps. In this
work, we reflect on the competent duties of Transformer components and repurpose
the Transformer architecture without any modification to the basic components. We
propose iTransformer that simply applies the attention and feed-forward network
on the inverted dimensions. Specifically, the time points of individual series are em-
bedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture
multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each
variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves
state-of-the-art on challenging real-world datasets, which further empowers the
Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization ability across differ-
ent variates, and better utilization of arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice
alternative as the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting. Code is avail-
able at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer .

cess in natural language processing (Brown et al., 2020) and
computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), growing into the foun-
dation model that follows the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020).
Inspired by the immense success in extensive fields, Transformer
with strong capabilities of depicting pairwise dependencies and
extracting multi-level representations in sequences is emerging
in time series forecasting (Wu et al., 2021; Nie et al., 2023).
However, researchers have recently begun to question the validity
of Transformer-based forecasters, which typically embed multiple
variates of the same timestamp into indistinguishable channels
and apply attention on these temporal tokens to capture temporal
dependencies. Considering the numerical but less semantic rela-
tionship among time points, researchers find that simple linear
layers, which can be traced back to statistical forecasters (Box &
Jenkins, 1968), have exceeded complicated Transformers on both performance and efficiency (Zeng
et al., 2023; Das et al., 2023). Meanwhile, ensuring the independence of variate and utilizing mutual

information is ever more highlighted by recent research that explicitly models multivariate correla-
tions to achieve accurate forecasting (Zhang & Yan, 2023; Ekambaram et al., 2023), but this goal can
be hardly achieved without subverting the vanilla Transformer architecture.
Considering the disputes of Transformer-based forecasters, we reflect on why Transformers perform
even worse than linear models in time series forecasting while acting predominantly in many other
fields. We notice that the existing structure of Transformer-based forecasters may be not suitable for
multivariate time series forecasting. As shown on the top of Figure 2, it is notable that the points
of the same time step that basically represent completely different physical meanings recorded by
inconsistent measurements are embedded into one token with wiped-out multivariate correlations.
And the token formed by a single time step can struggle to reveal beneficial information due to
excessively local receptive field and time-unaligned events represented by simultaneous time points.
Besides, while series variations can be greatly influenced by the sequence order, permutation-
invariant attention mechanisms are improperly adopted on the temporal dimension (Zeng et al.,
2023). Consequently, Transformer is weakened to capture essential series representations and portray
multivariate correlations, limiting its capacity and generalization ability on diverse time series data.
Concerning the potential risks of embedding multivariate points of a timestamp as a (temporal) token,
we take an inverted view on time series and embed the whole time series of each variate independently
into a (variate) token, the extreme case of Patching (Nie et al., 2023) that enlarges local receptive field.
By inverting, the embedded token aggregates the global representations of series that can be more
variate-centric and better leveraged by booming attention mechanisms for multivariate correlating.
Meanwhile, the feed-forward network can be proficient enough to learn generalizable representations
for distinct variates encoded from arbitrary lookback series and decoded to predict future series.
Based on the above motivations, we believe it is not that Transformer is ineffective for time series
forecasting, but rather it is improperly used. In this paper, we revisit the structure of Transformer and
advocate iTransformer as a fundamental backbone for time series forecasting. Technically, we embed
each time series as variate tokens , adopt the attention for multivariate correlations, and employ the
feed-forward network for series representations. Experimentally, the proposed iTransformer achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world forecasting benchmarks shown in Figure 1 and surprisingly
tackles the pain points of Transformer-based forecasters. Our contributions lie in three aspects:
•We reflect on the architecture of Transformer and refine that the competent capability of
native Transformer components on multivariate time series is underexplored.
•We propose iTransformer that regards independent time series as tokens to capture multivari-
ate correlations by self-attention and utilize layer normalization and feed-forward network
modules to learn better series-global representations for time series forecasting.
•Experimentally, iTransformer achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art on real-world bench-
marks. We extensively analyze the inverted modules and architecture choices, indicating a
promising direction for the future improvement of Transformer-based forecasters.

2 R ELATED WORK
With the progressive breakthrough made in natural language processing and computer vision areas,
elaboratively designed Transformer variants are proposed to tackle ubiquitous time series forecasting
applications. Going beyond contemporaneous TCNs (Bai et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022a) and RNN-
based forecasters (Zhao et al., 2017; Rangapuram et al., 2018; Salinas et al., 2020), Transformer has
exhibited powerful sequence modeling capability and promising model scalability, leading to the
trend of passionate modifications adapted for time series forecasting.
Through a systematical review of Transformer-based forecasters, we conclude that existing modifi-
cations can be divided into four categories by whether to modify the component and architecture.
As shown in Figure 3, the first category (Wu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022), which
is the most common practice, mainly concerns the component adaptation, especially the attention
module for the temporal dependency modeling and the complexity optimization on long sequences.
Nevertheless, with the rapid emergence of linear forecasters (Oreshkin et al., 2019; Zeng et al.,
2023; Das et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), the impressive performance and efficiency continuously
challenge this direction. Soon afterward, the second category attempts to fully utilize Transformer.
It pays more attention to the inherent processing of time series, such as Stationarization (Liu et al.,
2022b), Channel Independence, and Patching (Nie et al., 2023), which bring about consistently
improved performance. Moreover, faced with the increasing significance of the independence and
mutual interactions of multiple variates, the third category refurbishes Transformer in both aspects of
component and architecture. Representative (Zhang & Yan, 2023) explicitly captures the cross-time
and cross-variate dependencies by the renovated attention mechanism and architecture.
Unlike previous works, iTransformer modifies none of the native components of Transformer. Instead,
we adopt the components on the inverted dimensions with the altered architecture, as the only one that
belongs to the fourth category to our best knowledge. We believe the capabilities of the components
have stood the test extensively, the truth is that the architecture of Transformer is improperly adopted.

In multivariate time series forecasting, given historical observations X={x1, . . . ,xT} ∈RT×N
withTtime steps and Nvariates, we predict the future Stime steps Y={xT+1, . . . ,xT+S} ∈
RS×N. For convenience, we denote Xt,:as the simultaneously recorded time points at the step t, and
X:,nas the whole time series of each variate indexed by n. It is notable that Xt,:may not contain
time points that essentially reflect the same event in real-world scenarios because of the systematical
time lags among variates in the dataset. Besides, the elements of Xt,:can be distinct from each other
in physical measurements and statistical distributions, for which a variate X:,ngenerally shares.
3.1 S TRUCTURE OVERVIEW
Our proposed iTransformer illustrated in Figure 4 adopts the encoder-only architecture of Trans-
former (Vaswani et al., 2017), including the embedding, projection, and Transformer blocks.
Embedding the whole series as the token Most Transformer-based forecasters typically regard
multiple variates of the same time as the (temporal) token and follow the generative formulation of
forecasting tasks. However, we find the approach on the numerical modality can be less instructive for

learning attention maps, which is supported by increasing applications of Patching (Dosovitskiy et al.,
2021; Nie et al., 2023) that broadens the respective field. Meanwhile, the triumph of linear forecasters
also challenges the necessity of adopting a heavy encoder-decoder Transformer for generating tokens.
Instead, our proposed encoder-only iTransformer focuses on representation learning and adaptive
correlating of multivariate series. Each time series driven by the underlying complicated process
is firstly tokenized to describe the properties of the variate, applied by self-attention for mutual
interactions, and individually processed by feed-forward networks for series representations. Notably,
the task to generate the predicted series is essentially delivered to linear layers, which has been proven
competent by previous work (Das et al., 2023) and we provide a detailed analysis in the next section.
Based on the above considerations, in iTransformer, the process of predicting future series of each
specific variate ˆY:,nbased on the lookback series X:,nis simply formulated as follows:
h0
n= Embedding( X:,n),
Hl+1= TrmBlock( Hl), l= 0, . . . , L −1,
ˆY:,n= Projection( hL
n),(1)
where H={h1, . . . ,hN} ∈RN×Dcontains Nembedded tokens of dimension Dand the su-
perscript denotes the layer index. Embedding : RT7→RDandProjection : RD7→RSare
both implemented by multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The obtained variate tokens interact with each
other by self-attention and are independently processed by the shared feed-forward network in each
TrmBlock . Specifically, as the order of sequence is implicitly stored in the neuron permutation of the
feed-forward network, the position embedding in the vanilla Transformer is no longer needed here.
iTransformers The architecture essentially presupposes no more specific requirements on Trans-
former variants, other than the attention is applicable for multivariate correlation. Thus, a bundle of
efficient attention mechanisms (Li et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022) can be the plugins,
reducing the complexity when the variate number grows large. Besides, with the input flexibility of
attention, the token number can vary from training to inference, and the model is allowed to be trained
on arbitrary numbers of variates. The inverted Transformers, named iTransformers , are extensively
evaluated in experiments of Section 4.2 and demonstrate advantages on time series forecasting.
3.2 I NVERTED TRANSFORMER COMPONENTS
We organize a stack of Lblocks composed of the layer normalization, feed-forward network, and
self-attention modules. But their duties on the inverted dimension are carefully reconsidered.

Layer normalization Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) is originally proposed to increase
the convergence and training stability of deep networks. In typical Transformer-based forecasters,
the module normalizes the multivariate representation of the same timestamp, gradually fusing the
variates with each other. Once the collected time points do not represent the same event, the operation
will also introduce interaction noises between noncausal or delayed processes. In our inverted version,
the normalization is applied to the series representation of individual variate as Equation 2, which
has been studied and proved effective in tackling non-stationary problems (Kim et al., 2021; Liu
et al., 2022b). Besides, since all series as (variate) tokens are normalized to a Gaussian distribution,
the discrepancies caused by inconsistent measurements can be diminished. By contrast, in previous
architecture, different tokens of time steps will be normalized, leading to oversmooth time series.

Feed-forward network Transformer adopts the feed-forward network (FFN) as the basic building
block for encoding token representation and it is identically applied to each token. As aforementioned,
in the vanilla Transformer, multiple variates of the same timestamp that form the token can be
malpositioned and too localized to reveal enough information for predictions. In the inverted version,
FFN is leveraged on the series representation of each variate token. By the universal approximation
theorem (Hornik, 1991), they can extract complicated representations to describe a time series. With
the stacking of inverted blocks, they are devoted to encoding the observed time series and decoding
the representations for future series using dense non-linear connections, which work effectively as
the recent works completely built on MLPs (Tolstikhin et al., 2021; Das et al., 2023).
More interestingly, the identical linear operation on independent time series, which serves as the
combination of the recent linear forecasters (Zeng et al., 2023) and Channel Independence (Nie et al.,
2023), can be instructive for us to understand the series representations. Recent revisiting on linear
forecasters (Li et al., 2023) highlights that temporal features extracted by MLPs are supposed to be
shared within distinct time series. We propose a rational explanation that the neurons of MLP are
taught to portray the intrinsic properties of any time series, such as the amplitude, periodicity, and even
frequency spectrums (neuron as a filter), serving as a more advantageous predictive representation
learner than the self-attention applied on time points. Experimentally, we validate that the division of
labor helps enjoy the benefits of linear layers in Section 4.3, such as the promoted performance if
providing enlarged lookback series, and the generalization ability on unseen variates.
Self-attention While the attention mechanism is generally adopted for facilitating the temporal
dependencies modeling in previous forecasters, the inverted model regards the whole series of one
variate as an independent process. Concretely, with comprehensively extracted representations of
each time series H={h0, . . . ,hN} ∈RN×D, the self-attention module adopts linear projections to
get queries, keys, and values Q,K,V∈RN×dk, where dkis the projected dimension.
With denotation of qi,kj∈Rdkas the specific query and key of one (variate) token, we notice
that each entry of the pre-Softmax scores is formulated as Ai,j= (QK⊤/√dk)i,j∝q⊤
ikj. Since
each token is previously normalized on its feature dimension, the entries can somewhat reveal the
variate-wise correlation, and the whole score map A∈RN×Nexhibits the multivariate correlations
between paired variate tokens. Consequently, highly correlated variate will be more weighted for the
next representation interaction with values V. Based on this intuition, the proposed mechanism is
believed to be more natural and interpretable for multivariate series forecasting. We further provide
the visualization analysis of the score map in Section 4.3 and Appendix E.1.
4 E XPERIMENTS
We thoroughly evaluate the proposed iTransformer on various time series forecasting applications,
validate the generality of the proposed framework and further dive into the effectiveness of applying
the Transformer components on the inverted dimensions of time series.
Datasets We extensively include 7 real-world datasets in our experiments, including ECL, ETT (4
subsets), Exchange, Traffic, Weather used by Autoformer (Wu et al., 2021), Solar-Energy datasets

We also provide the experiments on Market (6 subsets) in Appendix F.4. It records the minute-
sampled server load of Alipay online transaction application with hundreds of variates, where we
consistently outperform other baselines. Detailed dataset descriptions are provided in Appendix A.1.
4.1 F ORECASTING RESULTS
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the forecasting performance of our
proposed model together with advanced deep forecasters.
Baselines We carefully choose 10 well-acknowledged forecasting models as our benchmark,
including (1) Transformer-based methods: Autoformer (Wu et al., 2021), FEDformer (Zhou et al.,
2022), Stationary (Liu et al., 2022b), Crossformer (Zhang & Yan, 2023), PatchTST (Nie et al., 2023);
(2) Linear-based methods: DLinear (Zeng et al., 2023), TiDE (Das et al., 2023), RLinear (Li et al.,
2023); and (3) TCN-based methods: SCINet (Liu et al., 2022a), TimesNet (Wu et al., 2023).
Main results Comprehensive forecasting results are listed in Table 1 with the best in redand the
second underlined . The lower MSE/MAE indicates the more accurate prediction result. Compared
with other forecasters, iTransformer is particularly good at forecasting high-dimensional time series.
Besides, PatchTST as the previous state-of-the-art, fails in many cases of PEMS, which can stem from
the extremely fluctuating series of the dataset, and the patching mechanism of PatchTST may lose
focus on specific locality to handle rapid fluctuation. By contrast, the proposed model aggregating
the whole series variations for series representations can better cope with this situation. Notably, as
the representative that explicitly captures multivariate correlations, the performance of Crossformer
is still subpar to iTransformer, indicating the interaction of time-unaligned patches from different
multivariate will bring about unnecessary noise for forecasting. Therefore, the native Transformer
components are competent for temporal modeling and multivariate correlating, and the proposed
inverted architecture can effectively tackle real-world time series forecasting scenarios.

4.2 ITRANSFORMERS GENERALITY
In this section, we evaluate iTransformers by applying our framework to Transformer and its vari-
ants, which generally address the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism, including
Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Informer (Li et al., 2021), Flowformer (Wu et al., 2022) and FlashAt-
tention (Dao et al., 2022). Surprising and promising discoveries are exhibited, indicating the simple
inverted perspective can enhance Transformer-based forecasters with promoted performance with
efficiency, generalization on unseen variates, and better utilization of historical observations.
Performance promotion We evaluate Transformers and the corresponding iTransformers with the
reported performance promotions in Table 2. It is notable that the framework consistently improves
various Transformers. Overall, it achieves averaged 38.9% promotion on Transformer, 36.1% on
Reformer, 28.5% on Informer, 16.8% on Flowformer and 32.2% on Flashformer, revealing the
previous improper usage of the Transformer architecture on time series forecasting. Moreover, since
the attention mechanism is adopted on the variate dimension in our inverted structure, the introduction
of efficient attentions with linear complexity essentially addresses the computational problem due to
6

numerous variates, which is prevalent in real-world applications but can be resource-consuming for
Channel Independence (Nie et al., 2023). Therefore, the idea of iTransformer can be widely practiced
on Transformer-based forecasters to take advantage of booming efficient attention mechanisms.

Variate generalization By inverting vanilla Transformers, it is notable that the models are empow-
ered with the generalization capability on unseen variates. Firstly, benefiting from the flexibility of the
number of input tokens, the amount of variate channels is no longer restricted and thus feasible to vary
from training and inference. Besides, feed-forward networks are identically applied on independent
variate tokens in iTransformer. As aforementioned, the neurons as filters learn the intrinsic patterns
of any time series, which are inclined to be shared and transferable among distinct variates.
To verify the hypothesis, we compare inverting with another generalizing strategy: Channel Indepen-
dence, training a shared backbone to forecast all variates. We partition the variates of each dataset
into five folders, train models with only 20% of variates of one folder, and directly forecast all
variates without fine-tuning. We compare the performance in Figure 5 and each bar presents the
averaged results of all folders to avoid the randomness of partition. CI-Transformers take a long time
to predict each variate one by one during inference while iTransformers directly predict all variates
and generally present smaller increases, indicating FFN is competent to learn transferable time series
representations. It leaves a potential direction to build a foundation model upon iTransformer, where
diverse multivariate time series with different numbers of variates can be feasibly trained together.

Figure 5: Performance of generalization on unseen variates. We partition the variates of each dataset
into five folders, train models with 20% variates, and use the partially trained model to forecast all
varieties. iTransformers can be trained efficiently and forecast with good generalizability.
Increasing lookback length Previous works have witnessed the phenomenon that the forecasting
performance does not necessarily improve with the increase of lookback length on Transformers (Nie
et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023), which can be attributed to the distracted attention on the growing input.
However, the desired performance improvement is generally held on linear forecasts, theoretically
supported by statistical methods (Box & Jenkins, 1968) with enlarged historical information to be

utilized. As the working dimensions of attention and feed-forward network are inverted, we evaluate
the performance of Transformers and iTransformer in Figure 6 with increased lookback length. The
results surprisingly verify the rationality of leveraging MLPs on the temporal dimension such that
Transformers can benefit from the extended lookback window for more precise predictions.

Figure 6: Forecasting performance with the lookback length T∈ {48,96,192,336,720}and fixed
prediction length S= 96 . While the performance of Transformer-based forecasters does not
necessarily benefit from the increased lookback length, the inverted framework empowers the vanilla
Transformer and its variants with improved performance on the enlarged lookback window.
4.3 M ODEL ANALYSIS
Ablation study To verify the rational business of Transformer components, we provide detailed
ablations covering both replacing components (Replace) and removing components (w/o) experiments.
The results are listed in Table 3. iTransformer that utilizes attention on the variate dimension and
feed-forward on the temporal dimension generally achieves the best performance. Notably, the
performance of vanilla Transformer (the third row) performs the worst among these designs, revealing
the potential risks of the conventional architecture, which we describe in detail in Appendix E.3.
Table 3: Ablations on iTransformer. We replace different components on the respective dimension
to learn multivariate correlations (Variate) and series representations (Temporal), in addition to
component removal. The average results of all predicted lengths are listed here.

Analysis of series representations To further validate the claim that feed-forward networks are
more favored to extract the series representations. We conduct representation analysis based on
the centered kernel alignment (CKA) similarity (Kornblith et al., 2019). A higher CKA indicates
more similar representations. For Transformer variants and iTransformers, we calculate the CKA
between the output features of the first and the last block. Notably, previous works have demonstrated
that time series forecasting, as a low-level generative task, prefers the higher CKA similarity (Wu
et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023) for the better performance. As shown in Figure 7, a clear division
line is exhibited, implying that iTransformers have learned more appropriate series representations
by inverting the dimension and thus achieve more accurate predictions. The results also advocate
inverting Transformer deserves a fundamental renovation of the forecasting backbone.

Analysis of multivariate correlations By assigning the duty of multivariate correlation to the
attention mechanism, the learned map enjoys enhanced interpretability. We present the case visual-
ization on series from Solar-Energy in Figure 7, which has distinct correlations in the lookback and
future windows. It can be observed that in the shallow attention layer, the learned map shares lots of
similarities to the correlations of raw input series. As it dives into deeper layers, the learned map
become gradually alike to the correlations of future series, which validates the inverted operation
empowers interpretable attention for correlating, and the processes of encoding the past and decoding
for the future are essentially conducted in series representations during feed-forwarding.

similarity of representations comparison between Transformers and iTransformers. A higher CKA
similarity indicates more favored representations for accurate predictions. Right: A case visualization
of multivariate correlations of raw time series and the learned score maps by inverted self-attention.
Efficient training strategy Due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, it can be overwhelm-
ing for training on numerous variates, which is very common in real-world scenarios. In addition to
efficient attention mechanisms, we propose a novel training strategy for high-dimensional multivariate
series by taking advantage of previously demonstrated variate generation capability. Concretely, we
randomly choose part of the variates in each batch and only train the model with selected variates.
Since the number of variate channels is flexible because of our inverting, the model can predict all
the variates for predictions. As shown in Figure 8, the performance of our proposed strategy is still
comparable with full-variate training, while the memory footprint can be reduced significantly.

5 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Considering the characteristics of multivariate time series, we propose iTransformer that inverts the
structure of Transformer without modifying any native modules. iTransformer regards independent
series as variate tokens to capture multivariate correlations by attention and utilize layer normalization
and feed-forward networks to learn series representations. Experimentally, iTransformer achieves
state-of-the-art performance and exhibits remarkable framework generality supported by promising
analysis. In the future, we will explore large-scale pre-training and more time series analysis tasks.

A I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A.1 D ATASET DESCRIPTIONS
We conduct experiments on 7 real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed
iTransformer including (1) ETT (Li et al., 2021) contains 7 factors of electricity transformer from
July 2016 to July 2018. There are four subsets where ETTh1 and ETTh2 are recorded every hour,
and ETTm1 and ETTm2 are recorded every 15 minutes. (2) Exchange (Wu et al., 2021) collects the
panel data of daily exchange rates from 8 countries from 1990 to 2016. (3) Weather (Wu et al., 2021)
includes 21 meteorological factors collected every 10 minutes from the Weather Station of the Max
Planck Biogeochemistry Institute in 2020. (4) ECL (Wu et al., 2021) records the hourly electricity
consumption data of 321 clients. (5) Traffic (Wu et al., 2021) collects hourly road occupancy rates
measured by 862 sensors of San Francisco Bay area freeways from January 2015 to December 2016.
(6) Solar-Energy (Lai et al., 2018) records the solar power production of 137 PV plants in 2006,
which are sampled every 10 minutes. (7) PEMS contains the public traffic network data in California
collected by 5-minute windows. We use the same four public subsets (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07,
PEMS08) adopted in SCINet (Liu et al., 2022a).
Apart from the public datasets widely used as forecasting benchmarks, we also collect a set of Market
datasets of a real-world application, which records the minute-sampled server load of Alipay online
transactions between January 30th, 2023, and April 9th, 2023 with the number of variates varied from
285 to 759. It includes 6 sub-datasets, which are divided according to diverse transaction domains.
We follow the same data processing and train-validation-test set split protocol used in TimesNet (Wu
et al., 2023), where the train, validation, and test datasets are strictly divided according to chronologi-
cal order to make sure there are no data leakage issues. As for the forecasting settings, we fix the
length of the lookback series as 96in ETT, Weather, ECL, Solar-Energy, PEMS, and Traffic, and the
prediction length varies in {96,192,336,720}. For the PEMS dataset, the prediction length varies in
{12,24,36,48}, which is the same as SCINet, the previous state-of-the-art on this dataset. For the
Market dataset, the lookback contains the past one day observations with 144time points and the
forecasting length varies in {12,24,72,144}. The details of datasets are provided in Table 4.

All the experiments are implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and conducted on a single
NVIDIA P100 16GB GPU. We utilize ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with an initial learning rate in
{10−3,5×10−4,10−4}and L2 loss for the model optimization. The batch size is uniformly set to 32
and the number of training epochs is fixed to 10. We set the number of inverted Transformer blocks in
our proposed model L∈ {2,3,4}. The dimension of series representations Dis set from {256,512}.
All the compared baseline models that we reproduced are implemented based on the benchmark of
TimesNet (Wu et al., 2023) Repository, which is fairly built on the configurations provided by each
model’s original paper or official code. We provide the pseudo-code of iTransformer in Algorithm 1.
We also report the standard deviation of iTransformer performance under five runs with different
random seeds in Table 5, which exhibits that the performance of iTransformer is stable.

B A BLATION STUDIES
To elaborate on the rational business of Transformer components, we conduct detailed ablations
covering replacing components (Replace) and removing components (w/o). Since the average results
are listed in Table 3 due to the paper limit, we provide detailed results and analysis here.
As shown in Table 6, among various architectural designs, iTransformer generally exhibits superior
performance, which learns multivariate correlations by self-attention and encodes series represen-
tations by FFN. Nevertheless, the arrangement of the vanilla Transformer can lead to degenerated
performance, indicating the misuse of Transformer components on the time series modality. Based
on the relatively poor results of the second (both attentions) and the third (the vanilla Transformer)
designs, one of the reasons for that may lie in the attention module over the temporal tokens of the
lagged time series, which we elaborate more with the datasets support in Section E.3.
It is also notable that applying FFN on both dimensions can also lead to fair performance on datasets
with small variate numbers (such as Weather with 21 variates). Still, with the increasing of variate
numbers in challenging multivariate forecasting tasks, the importance of capturing multivariate corre-
lations is ever more highlighted. We note that the heterogeneity of variates can be hardly considered
by the vanilla Transformer. During embedding, the variates are projected into indistinguishable
channels, which ignores the inconsistent physical measurements and thus fails to maintain the in-
dependence of variates, let alone capture and utilize the multivariate correlation. Consequently, by
incorporating the advanced attention module for the variate correlating, the first (iTransformer) and
the fifth (attention on variates) designs perform more effectively in challenging multivariate datasets.
In a nutshell, both temporal dependencies and multivariate correlations are of importance for mul-
tivariate time series forecasting. The proposed iTransformer employing the self-attention module
to disentangle the correlations between variate tokens proves to be more powerful and interpretable
than feed-forward networks, thereby further boosting the performance on challenging multivariate
datasets and enhancing the model capacity.
C H YPERPARAMETER SENSITIVITY
We evaluate the hyperparameter sensitivity of iTransformer with respect to the following factors: the
learning rate lr, the number of Transformer blocks L, and the hidden dimension Dof variate tokens.
The results are shown in Figure 9. We find that the learning rate, as the most common influencing
factor, should be carefully selected when the number of variates is large (ECL, Traffic). The block
number and hidden dimension are not essentially favored to be as large as possible in iTransformer.

with the efficient flow attention module (Wu et al., 2022); linear models: DLinear (Zeng et al., 2023)
and TiDE (Das et al., 2023); Transformers: Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), PatchTST (Nie
et al., 2023), and Crossformer (Zhang & Yan, 2023). The results are recorded with the official
model configuration and the same batch size. In Figure 10, we compare the efficiency under two
representative datasets (21 variates in Weather and 862 in Traffic) with 96time steps for lookback.
In a nutshell, the efficiency of iTransformer exceeds other Transformers in datasets with a relatively
small number of variates (Weather). In datasets with numerous variates (Traffic), the memory
footprints are basically the same as Transformers variates, but iTransformer can be trained faster.
Based on the complexity of O(N2)of the attention module, where Nis the number of tokens,
Transformer surpasses iTransformer on efficiency in this case because of N= 96 for the temporal
token and N= 862 for the variate token. Meanwhile, iTransformer achieves better performance
on numerous variates, since the multivariate correlations can be explicitly utilized. By adopting a
linear-complexity attention (Wu et al., 2022) or the proposed efficient training strategy as mentioned
in Figure 8 (trained on 20% variates and forecast all variates), iTransformer can enjoy a comparable
speed and memory footprint with linear models. Also, the two strategies can be adopted together.
E S HOWCASES
E.1 V ISUALIZATION OF MULTIVARIATE CORRELATIONS
By using the attention mechanism on variate tokens, the resulting learned map becomes more
interpretable. To present an intuitive understanding of the multivariate correlations, we provide three
randomly chosen case visualizations of the time series from Solar-Energy in Figure 11. We provide
the Pearson Correlation coefficients of each variate of the raw series by the following equation:
ρxy=P
i(xi−¯x)(yi−¯y)pP
i(xi−¯x)2pP
i(yi−¯y)2,
where xi, yi∈Rrun through all time points of the paired variates to be correlated. All the cases have
distinct multivariate correlations in the lookback and forecast window because the dataset exhibits
obvious seasonal changes in the daytime and night. On the second row of each case, we provide the
learned pre-Softmax maps of the self-attention module in both the first and the last layers. As we
observe in the shallow attention layer (left), we find that the learned map is similar to the correlations
of the raw lookback series. As we go deeper into the layers (right), the learned map gradually
becomes more similar to the correlations of the future series to be predicted. This demonstrates that
the inverted operation allows for interpretable attention in correlating, and that encoding of the past
and decoding for the future are conducted through series representations during layer stacking.

We present another interesting observation in Figure 12 to show that the attention module of iTrans-
former has enhanced interpretability. We provide randomly chosen multivariate time series from
Market. In this dataset, each variate represents the monitored values of a service interface of a kind,

and the service can be further grouped into refined application categories. We divide these variates
into corresponding applications (as listed on the top bar App), such that adjacent variates belong to
the same application and we reveal the application index by the top bar.
We visualize the time series of the variates and plot the learned multivariate correlations with the
marks of specific correlations between variates. On the one hand, we observe clear partitioning in
the multivariate correlations map, indicating the grouping of variates. On the one hand, the marked
correlation values can reflect the correlation of the raw series, where the similarity of variates from the
same application becomes closer than the pairs from the different groups. Therefore, highly correlated
variate will be leveraged for the next interaction and thus benefit for multivariate forecasting.

To provide a clear comparison among different models, we list supplementary prediction showcases of
four representative datasets in Figures 13- 16, which are given by the following models: iTransfomrer,
PatchTST (Nie et al., 2023), DLinear (Zeng et al., 2023), Crossformer (Zhang & Yan, 2023),
Autoformer (Wu et al., 2021), Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Among the various models,
iTransformer predicts the most precise future series variations and exhibits superior performance.

case of Traffic (Liu et al., 2022a), which is collected from sensors on Los Angeles city roads in
different areas. As shown in Figure 17, we can observe a strong correlation between the multivariate
time series of the dataset, while they also exhibit obvious phase offset, which is due to the systematical
time lags in the road occupancy that each series describes. Since the sensors are installed in different
areas of the highway, an event (such as a traffic jam) can affect road occupancy with different delays.

Figure 17: Visualization of partial variates of Traffic. We can observe that several series exhibit
strong synchronization (such as Sensor 2 and Sensor 4), and there also exist obvious delays and
advances between series (such as Sensor 1 and Sensor 2, Sensor 859 and Sensor 861).
Besides, we observe the significantly declined performance on the second and third designs of Traffic
in Table 6, which apply attention to temporal tokens. In our opinion, capturing temporal dependencies
by attention is not a big problem. But it is based on the fact that the time points of each timestamp
essentially reflect the same event to enclose a semantic representation. Since there are inherent delays
between the time points, the performance can degrade a lot because of the meaningless attention map,
unless the model has an enlarged respective field to learn about the decay or causal process.
Other risks can be aroused from the distinct variate measurements, such as organizing together
different meteorological indicators (the temperature and rainfall) in the Weather dataset (Wu et al.,
2021), and the quantity and proportion of the same observation in ILI (Wu et al., 2023). Given
these potential risks, iTransformer proposes a new paradigm that embeds the whole series as the
variate token, which can be more robust to extensive real-world scenarios, such as delayed events,
inconsistent measurements, irregular (unevenly spaced) time series, systematical delay of monitors,
and the time interval of generating and recording different time series.

F.1 F ULL PROMOTION RESULTS
We compare the performance of Transformer and iTransformer on all datasets in Table 7. Consistent
and great promotions can be achieved, indicating that the attention and feed-forward network on the
inverted dimensions greatly empower Transformers in multivariate time series forecasting, leaving an
instructive direction to build up the foundation model of extensive time series data.

F.3 F ULL RESULTS OF VARIATE GENERALIZATION
We divide the variates of each dataset into five folders, train models with only 20% of variates of one
folder, and directly forecast all variates without fine-tuning. We adopt two strategies for Transformers
to generalize on unseen variates: (1) CI-Transformers (Nie et al., 2023): Channel Independence
regards each variate of time series as independent channels, and trains with a shared backbone. During
inference, the model predicts variates one by one, but the procedure can be time-consuming. (2)
iTransformers : with the flexibility of the attention mechanism that the number of input tokens can
be dynamically changeable, the amount of variates as tokens is no longer restricted and thus feasible
to vary from training and inference, and can even allow the model to be trained on arbitrary variates.
As shown in Table 18, iTransformers can be naturally trained with 20% variates and accomplish
forecast on all variates with the ability to learn transferable representations.

Figure 18: Full performance of generalization on unseen variates, comparing the iTransformers with
CI-Transfomers. We divide the variates of each dataset into five folders, train with 20% variates, and
use the trained model to forecast all varieties. We plot the averaged results of all five folders.
F.4 F ULL FORECASTING RESULTS
The full multivariate forecasting results are provided in the following section due to the space limita-
tion of the main text. We extensively evaluate competitive counterparts on challenging forecasting
tasks. Table 9 contains the forecasting results on the four public subsets from PEMS (Liu et al.,
2022a). Table 10 contains the detailed results of all prediction lengths of the nine well-acknowledged
forecasting benchmarks. And Table 11 records the Market results for Alipay server load forecasting.
The proposed model achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art in real-world forecasting applications.
Table 9: Full results of the PEMS forecasting task. We compare extensive competitive models under
different prediction lengths following the setting of SCINet (2022a). The input length is set to 96 for
all baselines. Avgmeans the average results from all four prediction lengths.

G D ISCUSSIONS AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENT
G.1 D ISCUSSIONS ON ARCHITECTURE -FREE METHODS
Channel Independence (CI) (Nie et al., 2023), regarding variates of time series independently and
adopting the shared backbone, have gained increasing popularity in forecasting with performance
promotions as an architecture-free method. Recent works (Han et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) found
that while Channel Dependence (CD) benefits from a higher capacity ideally, CI can greatly boost
the performance because of sample scarcity, since most of the current forecasting benchmarks are
not large enough. We think it is essential to make variates independent, especially when there are
potential risks of embedding as mentioned in Appendix E.3, inducing the ideal model capacity of CD
limited by the excessively localized receptive field. However, the essence of CI, regarding multivariate
time series univariately, can lead to time-consuming training and inference and become an obstacle to
scalability. Still, multivariate correlations can not be explicitly utilized. Perpendicular to these works,
iTransformer repurposes an architecture with the native Transformer modules to tackle the issues.
RevIN (Kim et al., 2021) and Stationarization (Liu et al., 2022b) have been widely applied for the
distribution shift (non-stationarity) as architecture-free techniques. These works strive to reveal the
temporal dependency better. This is accomplished by layer normalization in iTransformer and still
leaves further improvement for us to tackle the distribution shift.
G.2 D ISCUSSIONS ON LINEAR FORECASTERS
Linear forecasters have natural advantages in modeling temporal dependencies. The dense weight-
ing (Zeng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) can reveal measurement-free relationships among the time
points of the same variate. More advanced linear forecasters focus on structural point-wise model-
ing (Oreshkin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022a; 2023). By contrast, iTransformer is particularly good at
forecasting high-dimensional time series (numerous variates with complicated correlations, which
can be common and realistic for practitioners in real forecasting applications). For variate correlating,
the embedding keeps the variate independent and the attention module can be applied to dig it out.
Under univariate scenarios, iTransformer actually becomes a stackable linear forecaster (attention
degradation), which leaves further enhancement to exploit the temporal dependency better.
G.3 D ISCUSSIONS ON TRANSFORMERS
We emphasize that iTransformer actually proposes a new perspective to think about the multivariate
time series modality, specifically, how to consider the variates and the tokenization. We list several
representatives in Figure 19. Transformer treats time series as the natural language but the time-
aligned embedding may bring about risks in multi-dimensional series. The problem can be alleviated
by expanding the receptive field. Although it is believed that Patching (Zhang & Yan, 2023; Nie et al.,
2023) can be more fine-grained, it also brings higher computational complexity and the potential
interaction noise between time-unaligned patches. If the current embedding (implemented by MLP)
is enhanced with more inductive bias (such as TCN), it may handle more robust cases with the variate
token paradigm and enjoy the flexibility of Transformer with changeable numbers of tokens.
We believe the capability and scalability of Transformer have stood the test by extensive fields, but
there is still improvement room to elaborately design components based on the inverted architecture,
such as efficient attention for multivariate correlation, structural temporal dependency modeling
under distribution shift, fine-grained variate tokenization and well-designed embedding mechanisms.
